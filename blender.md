# Blender

## Viewport

**Toggle quad and single view:** \
`ctrl` + `alt` + `q`

**Avoid middle mouse button navigation** \
Turn on 3 button mouse emulation to enable viewport navigation using left mouse button only. This is useful if you use a pen or have a mouse with a stiff middle mouse button. A stiff middle mouse button can lead to exhausting your hand/upper lower arm quickly.
